<!-- ls-a :- it shows all files including hidden files-->
<!-- untracked : new files that git doesn't yet track -->

<!-- Staged : file is ready to be committed -->
<!-- git add <file name>: adds new or changed files in your working directory to the git staging area. -->
<!-- commit : it is the record of change, e.g : git commit -m "some massages" -->
<!-- if we want to add html file then we write git add index.html -->
